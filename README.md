## Work Methodology

- **Proof of Work**: every commit represents a discrete, auditable milestone.
- **Technical Documentation**: each module includes a README detailing concepts, design decisions and usage.
- **Immediate Application**: concepts are exercised through katas, mini-projects and code reviews.
- **Continuous Review**: self-critique and peer feedback ensure code quality and maintainability.
- **Milestone Validation**: attainment of industry-recognized benchmarks (AWS Certified, dbt Fundamentals, etc.).
