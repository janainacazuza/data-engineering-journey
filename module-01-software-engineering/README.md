# Module 01: Software Engineering with Python

## Objective
Develop a software engineer focused on building robust and scalable systems. This module is the auditable, practical record of my continuous development, applying a systematic study methodology based on first principles and the canonical literature of software engineering. The goal is technical proficiency, validated through concrete and documented implementations.

## Main Bibliography
This portfolio is structured around five fundamental pillars, each representing a critical area of software engineering. Each pillar links to a directory containing the evidence of study and implementation:

| Pillar                       | Technical Description                                                                              | Canonical Sources                                                                                         |
